Python script for comparing exported modpacks from curseforge.
You need to install addons for this to work: pip install requests beautifulsoup4 selenium webdriver-manager
Script will compare what mods was added, removed or updated. Also it will detect what configs were changed and it will write down the changed configs and include the changes. This will work for options.txt as well.
